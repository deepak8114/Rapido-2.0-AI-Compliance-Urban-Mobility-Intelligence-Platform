# Rapido-2.0-AI-Compliance-Urban-Mobility-Intelligence-Platform
AI-powered solution to reimagine Rapido with legal compliance, accessibility, safety, and multilingual intelligence for India’s urban mobility challenges.
Introduction
Rapido 2.0 is a full-stack AI solution built to help India’s bike taxi platforms (Rapido, Ola, Uber) overcome state-level bans, enhance accessibility, boost legal compliance, and improve public trust. This project brings together advanced machine learning models, multilingual voice assistants, document verification, and a user-centric redesign of the ride-booking experience.

📌 Problem Statement

❌ Bike taxi bans in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra due to permit & legal ambiguity

🧑‍🦯 Poor accessibility: Delhi High Court flagged Rapido for non-compliance

🛡️ Security breach exposed thousands of user & driver records

😤 High ride cancellations, mismatch issues, and language barriers

 Project Goals

 Enable legal zone detection and adaptive ride availability

 Introduce inclusive dual-mode UI (PwD vs Regular)

 Integrate multilingual voice booking assistant

 Predict cancellations & optimize ETA with ML

 Strengthen ride verification, fraud detection, and SOS system

 Key Features

🧩 AI & ML Modules

XGBoost-based Cancellation Prediction Model

ETA Optimization using ride time + traffic + historical patterns

Smart Matching Algorithm to pair drivers based on cancellation history

Document Verification using OCR + Compliance Detection

LLM-Powered Customer Support (multi-language)

🎙️ Multilingual Voice Assistant

Understands native languages for ride booking

Guides users with speech prompts and confirmations

Specialized for visually impaired users with accessible flows

🧑‍💻 Dual UI/UX Design

Regular User: Clean layout, fast booking, minimal clicks

PwD Mode: High contrast, voice navigation, screen reader-ready
